      <h2>The Arthashastra and Its Writer</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Arthashastra</strong> is an ancient Indian text on statecraft, economics, and strategy. 
        It was written by <strong>Kautilya</strong>, also known as <em>Chanakya</em> or <em>Vishnugupta</em>, 
        who served as the advisor and mentor to Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.

      <h2>The Concept of Trayi</h2>
      <p>
        Kautilya emphasized the importance of <strong>Trayi</strong> – the threefold knowledge. 
        He believed that true wisdom comes when one seeks knowledge not only from scriptures and tradition, 
        but also from practical experience and self-discovery.  
        In essence, <em>“find yourself”</em> is the guiding principle of the Trayi.

      <h2>This Blog as a Modern Trayi</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by that vision, this site – <strong>Trayi</strong> – aims to explore the many dimensions of life.  
        Here, you will find reflections and discussions on diverse topics such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>World news and current affairs</li>
        <li>Religion and philosophy</li>
        <li>Ideas, concepts, and culture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Just like Kautilya’s Trayi combined wisdom, experience, and self-knowledge, 
        this blog aspires to be a space where knowledge and ideas meet.  
        Together, we can learn, reflect, and grow.
